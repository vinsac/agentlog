# GitHub Copilot/Codex Configuration

## Purpose

- Optimizes GitHub Copilot and Codex for this project
- Provides platform-specific instructions and best practices
- Enhances code generation quality and consistency
- Leverages OpenAI model capabilities effectively

## Platform Capabilities

- **Code Completion**: Real-time code suggestions
- **Function Generation**: Complete function implementations
- **Test Generation**: Automated test creation
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated comments and docs

## Configuration Guidelines

- **Context Optimization**: Structure files for better context understanding
- **Prompt Engineering**: Use effective comment patterns
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate model versions
- **Integration**: IDE-specific setup and shortcuts

## Best Practices

- Start with clear function signatures and comments
- Use descriptive variable names for better suggestions
- Provide context through meaningful file organization
- Review and refine generated code before acceptance

## Limitations

- **Context Window**: Limited to recent files and selections
- **Model Knowledge**: Cutoff date for training data
- **Language Support**: Stronger in some languages than others
- **Complexity**: May struggle with highly complex algorithms

## AI Agent Guidelines

- Structure code to maximize context relevance
- Use clear, descriptive comments to guide generation
- Validate generated code against project standards
- Provide feedback to improve future suggestions
