# Feature Specification Template

## Purpose

- Provides standardized template for feature specifications
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of all feature aspects
- Facilitates consistent documentation across features
- Guides AI agents in structured feature development

## Template Structure

### Overview
- **Feature Name**: [Clear, descriptive feature name]
- **Problem Statement**: [What problem does this solve?]
- **Business Value**: [Why is this important?]
- **Target Users**: [Who benefits from this feature?]

### Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**: [What the feature must do]
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: [Performance, security, etc.]
- **Constraints**: [Limitations and boundaries]
- **Dependencies**: [Required systems or features]

### Design
- **User Interface**: [UI/UX requirements]
- **API Design**: [Interface specifications]
- **Data Model**: [Data structures and relationships]
- **Integration Points**: [System interactions]

### Implementation
- **Architecture**: [Technical approach]
- **Components**: [Major components to build]
- **Workflow**: [Step-by-step implementation plan]
- **Testing Strategy**: [Test requirements and approach]

### Success Criteria
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [Specific, measurable requirements]
- **Performance Metrics**: [Benchmarks and targets]
- **Quality Standards**: [Code quality requirements]
- **User Experience**: [UX success measures]

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: [Implementation challenges]
- **Business Risks**: [Market and user risks]
- **Mitigation Strategies**: [Risk reduction approaches]

## Usage Guidelines

1. Complete all sections relevant to your feature
2. Be specific and measurable in requirements
3. Include diagrams and mockups where helpful
4. Review with stakeholders before implementation

## AI Agent Guidelines

- Use this template for all feature specifications
- Ensure completeness before starting development
- Reference this spec during implementation
- Update spec as requirements evolve
